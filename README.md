# Lobster Land Exploratory Analysis (2024 Season)

This repository contains my exploratory data analysis and visualization work for the Lobster Land 2024 dataset, completed as part of AD654: Marketing Analytics at Boston University. The project includes Python-based data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory plots, and a Tableau dashboard summarizing key operational insights.

## Dashboard Summary
The Tableau dashboard provides a clear, high-level view of Lobster Land’s 2024 season by combining visitor trends, revenue performance, and operational efficiency into a single, easy-to-interpret layout. The top section highlights overall attendance and revenue patterns across the summer, making it easy to spot peak periods and weather-driven fluctuations. A dedicated panel summarizes the impact of special events, showing how festivals and fireworks consistently boost both visitor volume and revenue. The dashboard also includes a focused view of staff efficiency, allowing management to compare labor allocation against daily revenue. Together, these visualizations give leadership a concise, data-driven understanding of what drives performance at Lobster Land and where operational adjustments could improve outcomes.
